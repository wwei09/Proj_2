<h3>Question 1:<br />
Interviewer: So, I see from your college transcript that you studied web design...</h3>

<div>
<p>Yes, through the Web Design course, I learned how to created my own webpages 
and&nbsp; basics of HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript.</p>
</div>

<h3>Question 2:<br />
Interviewer: Tell me about the roles of HTML, CSS and javascript</h3>

<div>
<p>The roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are distinct, but very interwoven. The 
HTML lays foundations of web site and all of its conent for the web page. The 
CSS adds styles to these contents that makes each web page unique in its design. 
The JavaScript adds functions and features to the content that allows the web 
page to perform multiple tasks. </p>
</div>

<h3>Question 3:<br />
Interviewer:
Was it largely a theory class or was there much hands-on?</h3>

<div>
<p>The class contained both theory and hands-on, but I would say there were more 
hands-on. We spend most our class time hams-on creating our own webpages.</p>
</div>

<h3>Question 4:<br />
Interviewer: What did you enjoy the most?</h3>

<div>
<p>The most interesting to me would be actually creating my own webpage. Even 
everything on it is about class assignments, but I actually enjoy the processes 
of creating the webpages.</p>

</div>

<h3>Question 5:<br/>
Interviewer: Is there anything you would like to add or change?</h3>
	<p>I think everything turn out great for me, so there's nothing I want to 
	add or change.</p>
